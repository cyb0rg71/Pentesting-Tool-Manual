### Nmap Cheatsheet

If you're looking to perform a fast Nmap scan, you might want to use specific options and flags to speed up the process. Here are some commonly used flags for a fast Nmap scan:
```
-F >> This flag enables a fast scan by only scanning the most common 100 ports

-T4 >> Sets the timing template to "Aggressive." It increases the speed of the scan.(Treads)

-n >> Disables DNS resolution. This can speed up the scan, especially if reverse DNS resolution is slow.

-Pn >> Treats all hosts as online, skipping the host discovery phase. This can save time if you know the host is online.

--max-rtt-timeout <time> >> Sets the maximum round-trip time for probes. This can speed up the scan by reducing the time spent waiting for responses.

--min-rate <number> >> Sets the minimum scan rate. This can be useful for speeding up the scan.

nmap --min-rate 500 <target>

--max-retries <tries> >> Sets the maximum number of port scan probe retransmissions. Reducing this number can speed up the scan.

nmap --max-retries 3 <target>

--open >> Shows only open (or possibly open) ports, reducing the amount of output and speeding up the scan.

Example: sudo nmap 10.10.96.148 -p- -sT --min-rate 500 -n -sVC -Pn -oN nmap -vv >> Use this flag switches for fast scan.
